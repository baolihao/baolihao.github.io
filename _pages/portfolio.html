<h2>1. Learning Interaction Laws and Collective Dynamics</h2>

<p>Our research focuses on learning the governing mechanisms of collective behavior from data, with particular 
emphasis on discovering interaction kernels in agent-based dynamical systems. 
These systems arise in diverse applications, including swarming, flocking, synchronization, and social dynamics. 
A central challenge is to infer effective interaction laws from **limited observations**, 
often without access to full trajectories or explicit force measurements.</p>

<p>We develop structure-aware and data-efficient learning methods that combine tools from dynamical systems, 
statistical learning, and approximation theory. This includes kernel learning from trajectories and steady states, 
identifiability analysis, and convergence guarantees. A major outcome of this work is a 
framework that enables the recovery of interaction laws governing emergent patterns such as clustering, alignment, and phase transitions.</p>
