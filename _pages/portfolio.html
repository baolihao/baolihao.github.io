<h2>1. Learning Interaction Laws and Collective Dynamics</h2>
<img src="/images/scatter_movie-N30.gif" width="420" align="right">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our research focuses on <b>learning the governing mechanisms of collective behavior from data</b>, with particular 
emphasis on discovering interaction kernels in agent-based dynamical systems. 
These systems arise in diverse applications, including swarming, flocking, synchronization, and social dynamics. 
A central challenge is to infer effective interaction laws from <b>limited observations</b>, 
often without access to full trajectories or explicit force measurements.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We develop structure-aware and data-efficient learning methods that combine tools from dynamical systems, 
statistical learning, and approximation theory. This includes kernel learning from trajectories and steady states, 
identifiability analysis, and convergence guarantees. A major outcome of this work is a 
framework that enables the recovery of interaction laws governing emergent patterns such as clustering, alignment, and phase transitions.</p>

<h2>2. Crime Pattern Formation and Predictive Policing</h2>
<img src="/images/CHI.gif" width="420" align="right">
<p style="text-align: justify;">This research examines how spatio-temporal crime patterns emerge from individual-level interactions, with a focus on the 
formation and evolution of crime hotspots. Building on PDE-based burglary models originally introduced by 
<a href = "https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/papers/M3AS-final.pdf">Bertozzi and collaborators</a>, 
which describe feedback between criminal density and environmental attractiveness, We study their behavior in realistic urban settings.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We develop and implement a finite element framework based on the variational formulation of these models, 
enforcing natural boundary conditions and proposing an efficient decoupled numerical scheme that improves robustness. 
This approach enables simulations with heterogeneous parameters and complex geometries, and is validated against agent-based results. Ongoing work extends
the framework to incorporate police response, supporting predictive analytics and decision support for urban public safety.

<h2>3. Physics-Informed Neural Networks for PDEs</h2>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/sciml02.png" width="500">
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We developed data-driven solvers based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that explicitly 
  enforce physical constraints to mitigate ill-conditioning and spectral bias in stiff, 
  time-dependent partial differential equations. The work systematically investigates hard enforcement of initial conditions and adaptive loss weighting to address 
  the instability and inefficiency commonly encountered in multiscale and rapidly evolving dynamics.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> We conducted a large-scale ablation study across representative stiff PDE systems arising
  in materials science and mathematical biology, including Allen–Cahn, Cahn–Hilliard, and Gray–Scott equations, etc. 
  The study quantifies how precise constraint enforcement and dynamically balanced loss terms improve training
  robustness, accuracy, and convergence efficiency, particularly in regimes characterized by sharp gradients and disparate 
  temporal scales. Extensive numerical benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed training strategies significantly enhance 
  PINN performance for stiff and chaotic dynamics,  offering practical guidance for reliable physics-constrained 
  learning in challenging PDE settings. Please see my <a href="/publications/">Publications</a> page for prints of all these works and more.</p>


<h2>4. Ion Transport and Poisson–Nernst–Planck Models</h2> 
<img src="/images/PNP.jpg" width="300" align="left">
<p>
  Another strand of my research concerns ion transport in confined systems, 
  modeled by Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations with steric effects, cross-diffusion, 
  and dynamic boundary conditions. 
  These models are motivated by applications in electrochemistry and biological transport.</p>

<p>We focus on the mathematical analysis of these systems, including energy identities, 
  dissipation mechanisms, and the global existence of weak solutions. 
  By incorporating physically meaningful boundary dynamics, this work improves the fidelity of continuum models 
  for charged species transport near interfaces.
