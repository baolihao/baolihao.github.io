<h2>1. Learning Interaction Laws and Collective Dynamics</h2>
<img src="/images/scatter_movie-N30.gif" width="420" align="right">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our research focuses on <b>learning the governing mechanisms of collective behavior from data</b>, with particular 
emphasis on discovering interaction kernels in agent-based dynamical systems. 
These systems arise in diverse applications, including swarming, flocking, synchronization, and social dynamics. 
A central challenge is to infer effective interaction laws from <b>limited observations</b>, 
often without access to full trajectories or explicit force measurements.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We develop structure-aware and data-efficient learning methods that combine tools from dynamical systems, 
statistical learning, and approximation theory. This includes kernel learning from trajectories and steady states, 
identifiability analysis, and convergence guarantees. A major outcome of this work is a 
framework that enables the recovery of interaction laws governing emergent patterns such as clustering, alignment, and phase transitions.</p>

<h2>2. Crime Pattern Formation and Predictive Policing</h2>
<img src="/images/CHI.gif" width="420" align="right">
<p style="text-align: justify;">This research examines how spatio-temporal crime patterns emerge from individual-level interactions, with a focus on the 
formation and evolution of crime hotspots. Building on PDE-based burglary models originally introduced by 
<a href = "https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/papers/M3AS-final.pdf">Bertozzi and collaborators</a>, 
which describe feedback between criminal density and environmental attractiveness, We study their behavior in realistic urban settings.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We develop and implement a finite element framework based on the variational formulation of these models, 
enforcing natural boundary conditions and proposing an efficient decoupled numerical scheme that improves robustness and scalability. 
This approach enables simulations with heterogeneous parameters and complex city geometries, 
including Chicago, and is validated against agent-based results. Ongoing work extends
the framework to incorporate police response, supporting predictive analytics and decision support for urban public safety.
