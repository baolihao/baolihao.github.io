Welcome to my homepage! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in **Applied Mathematics** at the [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.edu/applied-math), where I am advised by [Prof. Chun Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/chunliu) and [Prof. Ming Zhong](https://mingjzhong.github.io/) (University of Houston). I received my B.Sc. in **Computing Mathematics** (First Class Honours) from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/ma/), with a minor in **Computer Science**. 

My research focuses on mathematical modeling and scientific machine learning for complex dynamical systems, with an emphasis on PDE analysis, emergent behaviors in multi-agent dynamics, and stability-aware learning methods such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
